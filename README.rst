The Books
---------

The readings used by this study group are a careful selection of different chapter from the following books:

* `Design Patterns Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software`_
* `Head First Design Patterns`_
* `Design Patterns Explained`_
* `Holub on Patterns`_
* `Refactoring to Pattern`_
* `Elemental Design Patterns`_
* `Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications`_
* `Code Complete`_
* `Effective Java`_

Official Pattern Catalog
------------------------

Initially the group will cover the basic GoF design patterns. However there is no reason why the group cannot later work on other pattern catalogs from other domains (e.g. `JEE <https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Java-EE-Design-Patterns/dp/111884341X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1422162198&sr=1-1&keywords=Java+EE+PAtterns>`_, `Enterprise Applications <https://www.amazon.com/Patterns-Enterprise-Application-Architecture-Martin/dp/0321127420/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1422162238&sr=1-1&keywords=patterns+of+enterprise+application+architecture>`_, `SOA <https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Prentice-Service-Oriented-Computing/dp/0136135161/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1422162269&sr=1-2&keywords=soa+patterns>`_, `Integration <https://www.amazon.com/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Deploying/dp/0321200683/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1422162295&sr=1-1&keywords=enterprise+integration+patterns>`_, `Functional <https://www.amazon.com/Functional-Programming-Patterns-Scala-Clojure/dp/1937785475/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1422162317&sr=1-1&keywords=Functional+Programming+patterns>`_, `Service <https://www.amazon.com/Service-Design-Patterns-Fundamental-Solutions/dp/032154420X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1515981953&sr=1-1&keywords=Service+Design+Patterns>`_, etc.)
